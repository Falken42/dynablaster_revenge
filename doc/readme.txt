About

   Dynablaster Revenge is a remake of the game Dynablaster, released by
   Hudson Soft in 1991. The goal of this remake is to keep the original
   game-play as untouched as possible while adding some new features such as
   networked multiplayer and real-time 3D rendering. In case you're not yet
   familiar with the original game goal, it's quite simple: Bomb all other
   players from the screen. Either by collecting flame extras to increase the
   bomb radius or by picking up bomb extras in order to have more bombs to
   drop you're able to surround your enemies with your bombs, or blow them
   away with clever bomb chain reactions.


Requirements

   To run the game you need a video-card with OpenGL 3.0 support and at least
   512MB of video memory.

   It works properly with the following cards:
    - Nvidia Geforce GTX 560 Ti
    - Nvidia Geforce 8800 GTS
    - Nvidia Geforce 9600 GT
    - AMD Radeon HD 6540
    - AMD Radeon HD 6850
    - AMD Radeon HD 7750
    - Intel HD Graphics 4000

   If the required OpenGL features are not available, the game will not start 
   and you'll just see a message box. In this case it can help to update the 
   video driver. Also make sure you're using a driver from the video card 
   vendor and not, for example, Microsoft's default driver.

   Extras

      Bomb    Pick up the bomb extra and you'll have one more bomb to place.
              This is one of the most simple extras; with it and some practice
              you may learn tactics to drive your opponents into a corner.

      Flame   Collect the flame extra to create larger detonations. With each
              additional flame you'll be able to reach one more space with your
              bombs. Always keep track on the number of bombs your opponents
              have collected – it could save your life.

      Speedup As the name suggests, your player's speed will increase with each
              speedup collected. Speedups will make your player much more agile
              and let you reach extras before your opponents do.

      Kick    You’ll either love or hate this one – kick extras enable you to
              kick bombs away until they reach any obstacle like players, walls
              or other bombs. This extra will definitely mess up all your
              opponent's tactics.

      Skulls  This extra actually consists of six separate ones. Once the skull
              extra is revealed you’ll see a rotating cube; each side of the
              cube represents a different effect when picked up. There’s one
              that will make your player drop bombs all the time, another one
              that will flip your controls, and a third that will restrict your
              bombs to a single flame. The mushroom skull will make you quite
              dizzy, but there’s also cool stuff: invisibility and
              invincibility – yes, invincibility. By the way, the skull
              extra is predictable – you’ll soon find out how it works.

   Multiplayer
   
      Quick Guide to Local Multiplayer Setup:

         1) Connect a load of USB controllers to your PC. A joypad is required 
            for each additional player - wired Xbox 360 pads work perfectly.
         2) Load the game, set the IP address as 127.0.0.1 and select 'Multi'. 
            This will open a server on your PC. Create a new game and when in 
            the 'Lounge', add your friends to the game by pressing the 'add 
            local player' button. Alternatively you may use the hotkeys [shift] 
            and [+] or [ctrl] and [=] depending on what's more convenient with 
            your keyboard layout. 
            
         Please note a 'complete' implementation is scheduled for version 1.2;
         i.e. a new menu page will be introduced for this mode.

      Quick Guide to LAN Multiplayer Setup:

         1) Set the IP address to 127.0.0.1, and select 'Multi'. This will open 
            a server on your PC.
         2) The other players then just have to connect to your IP address by 
            entering your IP into the hostname field. If you don't know your IP 
            just press F4 in the menus.

      Quick Guide to Online Multiplayer Setup:

         The best option here is to have a dedicated server (a 'Linux shell' or 
         a Windows machine connected to a fast internet connection) you can run 
         the server on. If this is not an option, you can use Titan's own server 
         by typing 'dynablaster.titan-sucks.net' in the IP field on the title 
         screen.

         If you just want to use your own connection in order to play over the 
         internet, you can still set up a port forwarding from your router 
         (if you have one) to your PC (i.e. make your router forward all traffic 
         on port 6300 to your PCs IP). Host your server on 127.0.0.1, as you 
         would for a LAN game, then tell your friends your internet IP address 
         (not the LAN one of course) so they can connect.
            
         
      FAQ

         Q: Why am I having trouble placing bombs and moving the player at
            the same time?
         A: This can be related to keyboard ghosting. Have a look at
            http://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/antighostingexplained.mspx
            in order to see which keys work fine for you.

         Q: Your bots could be improved in so many ways. Why don't you make
            them better?
         A: They're not perfect by intention. It makes them more amiable :)

         Q: Why isn't there a Mac port?
         A: We don't have a Mac.
